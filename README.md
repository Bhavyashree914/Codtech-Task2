Project Overview: Student Grades Manager


The Student Grades Manager is a Python program designed to help users track, calculate, and analyze student grades. It offers features to add grades, calculate averages, and provide a comprehensive performance overview.

Objectives:


To provide an intuitive interface for managing grades for various subjects or assignments.
To calculate and display key performance metrics like:
Average grade.
Letter grade (based on the average).
Grade Point Average (GPA).
To provide detailed feedback for students or academic purposes.

Features:


Grade Entry:


Users can input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Validation ensures grades are within the range of 0 to 100.
Performance Metrics:
Calculates the average grade.
Converts the average to a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.).
Computes the GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Detailed Reporting:
Displays all entered grades with subject/assignment names.
Summarizes overall performance metrics for quick evaluation.
Interactive Menu:
Simple menu system allows users to:
Add grades.
View performance metrics.
Exit the program.


Program Flow:

Menu Options:
Users choose between adding grades, viewing overall performance, or exiting the program.
Data Collection:
Users enter subject/assignment names and corresponding grades.
Calculations:
The program calculates the average, letter grade, and GPA based on entered grades.
Display Results:
Outputs a detailed performance summary and individual grades.
Learning Outcomes:
Data Handling: Demonstrates collection, storage, and processing of user data (grades).
Validation and Error Handling:
Ensures grades are numeric and within a valid range.
Handles invalid menu choices gracefully.
Control Flow:
Implements a menu-driven system for user interaction.


Modularity:


Separates key functionalities into reusable functions.
Potential Enhancements:
Add functionality to save grades persistently (e.g., file storage or database integration).
Introduce weighted grades for assignments and subjects.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
Allow exporting performance reports to a file (e.g., CSV or PDF).
This project serves as a practical exercise in building a grade management system, teaching essential programming concepts like input handling, conditionals, loops, and basic data processing. It can be extended for real-world academic use or as a foundational component for more complex student information systems.
